# Restaurant Savore
This is a site that I built for a 5 star restaurant. It is a clean and open layout allowing for plenty of text and background images.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This side is mostly comprised of text with background images. Flexbox was used to position everything with media queries for mobile formatting.

## Optimizations
I plan to update this later by adding videos and links to the current placeholders. 

## Lessons Learned:

Flexible layouts can be challenging, especially as you add more and more content. Overlapping content can be cumbersome. I encountered all of that with this layout. I definitely became more confortable with flexbox and managing margin space while building this site.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
